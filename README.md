# CSharp-HQC-Code-Documentation-Comments
High Quality Code

Problem 1.	String Extensions
You are given Visual Studio source code file StringExtensions.cs. Create XML documentation for the file, all classes and class members. Add appropriate comments in the code where this may improve code readability and understandability.

Problem 2.	Interfaces Documentation
In big companies, documenting public interfaces is required. Use one of the OOP exams, preferably one that you have already solved. You can either use your own solution or the author's solution. Document all public interfaces using the best practices for documenting code. You don't need to document anything else in the project.
For this problem, submit the full exam project, with the documentation inside the interface declarations.
